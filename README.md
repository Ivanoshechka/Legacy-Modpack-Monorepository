Re-Console is the official modpack for the Legacy4J mod, seeking to expand upon it, improve performance and add QoL features on top of the mod itself.

# 🎯 Goals

### 🔍 Accuracy
Re-Console seeks to be accurate to an idea of "Legacy Console Edition if it never ended". This means the modpack does not seek to re-create old versions, but rather make LCE in the modern versions.

### ⚙️ Open Source
Re-Console is comprised of only open-source or source-available mods, which gives you the ability to see the code and contribute to the mods in the pack. Without mod developers hard work, Re-Console would not be possible. If you want to show the developers of these mods your appreciation, I encourage you to donate to them!

### 🚀 Performant
Re-Console is built off of [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) by [devin](https://modrinth.com/user/devin), the performance modpack officially endorsed by Sodium.
This means Re-Console comes with all the features within [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), including;
- Improved rendering & game logic performance
- Improved memory and hardware usage
- Improved world generation speed

### 📩 Up to Date
Re-Console is usually one of the first modpacks to update in a stable state to new Minecraft and Legacy4J versions. It is also multi-version and multi-loader, giving you the choice between Latest MC (currently 1.21.1) and a version with long-term mod compatibility (currently 1.20.1) on both Fabric and Neoforge.
