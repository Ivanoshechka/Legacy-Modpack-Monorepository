Welcome back to your childhood.

Re-Console is the official modpack for the Legacy4J mod, seeking to be as accurate as to the idea of if Legacy Console Edition never ended as possible.
We do this via a variety of mods, resource packs and occasionally datapacks!

We seek to be as up-to date as possible update wise, mod wise and performance wise. The fastest time we updated in accordance with Legacy4J was a time of only **3 minutes!**
<p> We seek to be the gold standard of LCE modpacks, trying to push the ecosystem forward!

![Features](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/97029679acef552aaa93810310bee9e0f287dc5d.webp)
- Near 100% Legacy Console Edition parity
- Lightweight and performant; built on the [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) modpack, tweaked specifically for the most optimal, stable performance
- Every tutorial world, from TU1 to TU69
- Entirely configurable and community oriented
- Optional old world generation, spanning from Beta 1.7.3 to 1.17.1
<p> Re-Console, and all the mods inside of it are either Open Source or Source Available!

<summary>Important note for MacOS users</summary>

Re-Console needs the SDL2 framework to run, which is not installed on macOS by default. Here is a quick tutorial to do so:

1) Install the latest release here (for mac, it will be the .dmg installer): https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases
2) Run the installer
3) Open a new finder window, and in the upper left-hand portion of the screen, click `go`, `go to folder`, and enter this path: `/Library/Frameworks`
4) Drag the `SDL2.framework` folder from the installer to the framework directory
5) Launch ReConsole using the launcher of your choice. Click OK on the promts until your instance crashes
6) Open `System Settings`, go to `Privacy & Security`, and scroll down to where you see `"SDL2.framework" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.`. Click `Allow Anyway`.
7) You can now launch ReConsole!
