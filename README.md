Re-Console is the official modpack for the Legacy4J mod! We try to acomplish the idea of if Legacy Console Edition never ended.
We use a variety of mods and resource packs to achieve this.

We always seek to be as up to date as possible regarding Minecraft versions and mods.
Re-Console seeks to push the ecosystem forward by always being up to date.

![Features](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/97029679acef552aaa93810310bee9e0f287dc5d.webp)

Re-Console comes with numerous features and QoL not found in the base mod or other modpacks.
It is built with configurability, performance and ease of use in mind.

### This includes, but is not limited to:
- Controller Support
- Lightweight and performant; built on the [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) modpack, for the most optimal, stable performance.
- Near 100% Legacy Console Edition parity
- Old Combat from 1.8
- Optional old world generation, spanning from Beta 1.7.3 to 1.17.1
- Some of the old LCE texture packs and Mash-Up packs

### There's also some extra QoL features that can improve the user experience, such as:
- Borderless Fullscreen mode (Mods>Minecraft>Video Settings to enable)
- Custom Color support
- Free multiplayer via E4MC, open to LAN and send the link to your friends to play!
- Input fixes for MacOS and Linux
- Optifine resource pack features


<p> Re-Console, and all the mods inside of it are either Open Source or Source Available!

<summary>Important note for MacOS users</summary>

Re-Console needs the SDL2 framework to run, which is not installed on macOS by default. Here is a quick tutorial to do so:

1) Install the latest release here (for mac, it will be the .dmg installer): https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases
2) Run the installer
3) Open a new finder window, and in the upper left-hand portion of the screen, click `go`, `go to folder`, and enter this path: `/Library/Frameworks`
4) Drag the `SDL2.framework` folder from the installer to the framework directory
5) Launch ReConsole using the launcher of your choice. Click OK on the promts until your instance crashes
6) Open `System Settings`, go to `Privacy & Security`, and scroll down to where you see `"SDL2.framework" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.`. Click `Allow Anyway`.
7) You can now launch ReConsole!
