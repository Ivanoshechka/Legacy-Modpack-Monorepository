Re-Console is the official modpack for the Legacy4J mod! We try to acomplish the idea of if Legacy Console Edition never ended.
We use a variety of mods and resource packs to achieve this.

We always seek to be as up to date as possible regarding Minecraft versions and mods.
Re-Console seeks to push the ecosystem forward by always being up to date.

Re-Console is actively maintained for 1.20.1 and 1.21.1.

**Re-Console is currently available on Modrinth, Curseforge and GitHub. It is not hosted anywhere else.**

Some of the features on this list may not be present in the Curseforge version due to licensing restrictions

Re-Console comes with numerous features and QoL not found in the base mod or other modpacks.
It is built with configurability, performance and ease of use in mind.

### This includes, but is not limited to:
- A programmer art add-on which retextures the game
- Controller Support
- Lightweight and performant; built on the [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) modpack, for the most optimal, stable performance.
- Near 100% Legacy Console Edition parity
- Nostalgic Tweaks, giving very much control over each and every feature in the game
- Old Combat from 1.8
- Optional old world generation, spanning from Beta 1.7.3 to 1.17.1
- Some of the old LCE texture packs and Mash-Up packs

### There's also some extra QoL features that can improve the user experience, such as:
- An easy to use calculator which can calculate anything from basic calculations to nether portal calculations, farm rate calculations and more.
- Borderless Fullscreen mode (Mods>Minecraft>Video Settings to enable)
- Dark Mode resource pack to save your eyes some strain
- Free multiplayer via World Host, open to LAN and send the link to your friends to play!
- Input fixes for MacOS and Linux
- Optifine resource pack features*
- Shader Support
- Easy to use Zoom mod


<p> Re-Console is available as a Packwiz project on GitHub, along with striving to use only open source or source available mods.

### Notice 
- This project is currently ***incompatible*** with the Legacy Edition Minigames server! Please see the list of alternatives for modpacks that work with the server.
