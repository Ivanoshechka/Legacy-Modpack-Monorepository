## Info
Welcome back to your childhood.

Re-Console is the official modpack for the Legacy4J mod, seeking to be as accurate as to the idea of if Legacy Console Edition never ended as possible.
We do this via the Legacy4J mod, with slight modifications to make it our vision of what it would have been.

We seek to be as up-to date as possible update wise, mod wise and performance wise.

## Features
- Incredibly lightweight and performant; even being able to run of 512mb of ram!
- Near 100% LCE Parity, including mip-mapping, gamma systems, tutorial worlds
- ***optional*** old world generation from Beta 1.1, Beta 1.7.3, Beta 1.8.1, Beta 1.9, 1.0.0, 1.2.5, 1.6.4, 1.12.2 and 1.17.1!
- Consistent, quality updates!
- Almost entirely configurable, including worlds!
